# selfbot

You will need:

Discord client

rdp vm vps to use cause this takes over keyboard

Disboard bot in server to be bumped

once you have all of that run main.py

You will now have 10 seconds to click the text channel that you would like to bump

Leave your cursor idle in that chat window

Voila every two hours your server is bumped.
